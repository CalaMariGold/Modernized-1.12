<h2>⭐ Summary &amp; Design Philosophy</h2>
<p><strong>Modernized 1.12 – The Apocalypse</strong> is a grounded, survival-driven Minecraft modpack built on <strong>Minecraft 1.12.2</strong>, set in a world that has already collapsed. Survival is no longer guaranteed, and comfort must be earned.</p>
<p>Civilization is gone. Resources are scarce. The environment itself works against you. Hostile mobs are more numerous, systems are harsher, and careless exploration is often fatal. Early progression is intentionally slow and deliberate, demanding caution, planning, and adaptation.</p>
<p>This modpack is a fork of <strong>Modernized 1.12 by CalimariGold</strong>, retaining its highly optimized and modernized technical foundation while deliberately diverging in gameplay direction. Where Modernized 1.12 focuses on preserving and refining the vanilla experience, <strong>The Apocalypse</strong> uses that performance headroom to support heavier systems, smarter threats, and long-form survival gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>Technically faithful. Gameplay divergent.</strong></p>
<p>Difficulty emerges from interacting systems rather than randomness or artificial punishment. Balance favors <strong>survivability over convenience</strong>. The experience is bleak, but not hopeless. Through mastery of systems and eventual access to advanced technology, players can reclaim stability, rebuild, and push back against a hostile world. Hope exists, but it lies far on the horizon.</p>

<h2>🔒 Version Locked: Minecraft 1.12.2</h2>
<p>Minecraft 1.12.2 was chosen deliberately.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Cleanroom team and continued community development, 1.12 remains exceptionally stable, highly optimized, and surprisingly modern. In many cases, it performs better than newer versions while offering a deeper and more complete mod ecosystem.</p>
<p>After years of evaluating newer versions, many essential mods were found to be missing, unpolished, or incompatible at scale. In contrast, 1.12 provides a mature, battle-tested mod library that allows this pack to be fully realized without compromise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete and polished mod selection</li>
<li>Strong performance and stability</li>
<li>Long-term maintainability</li>
<li>Freedom to design without missing core mechanics</li>
</ul>

<h2>📜 License &amp; Usage</h2>
<p>You are free to use, copy, and modify any part of this modpack for your own projects, including configurations and scripts.</p>
<p><strong>Attribution is strongly encouraged.</strong> Please credit <strong>Modernized 1.12 by CalimariGold</strong>, as it forms the foundation of this project.</p>
<p>To support the broader 1.12 ecosystem, derivative projects are encouraged to remain open source where possible. Always respect and follow the individual licenses of included mods.</p>
